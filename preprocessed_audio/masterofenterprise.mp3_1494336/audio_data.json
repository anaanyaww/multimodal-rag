    "transcript": "Recorded books is pleased to present the modern scholar series, where great professors teach you. My name is Richard Davidson, and I'll be your host. Today, we begin a course entitled Masters of Enterprise, a history of American business and those who made it. Your professor is H.W. Brands, a prolific and award-winning writer who's currently distinguished professor of history and holder of the Melbourne G. Glasscock Chair in American History at Texas A&M in College Station, Texas. Professor Brands earned a BA in history from Stanford University in 1975. After spending a year working as a traveling salesman, Brands took a job teaching history in Portland, Oregon's Jesuit High School, while earning both an MA in liberal studies from Reed College and an MS in mathematics from Portland State University. He went on to receive his PhD in history from the University of Texas. Brands is the author of seventeen books, has edited for others, and has published dozens of articles and reviews in publications ranging from the New York Times to the American Historical Review. That's the formation of the American Republic. The principles of free enterprise and equal opportunity have been at the very core of economic philosophy. During the revolution colonists fought not only for intangibles like liberty and justice, but also for the promises of a free market that provided everyone with the opportunity to pursue economic advancement regardless of social position and without interference from the crown. America quickly became a society in which an individual success would be measured not by birthright, but rather by determination. In this atmosphere, men and women have sought fortune limited only by their own abilities, their willingness to work hard, and their courage in the face of unknown dangers. In this course, we'll explore the lives and careers of successful men and women who seize the opportunities offered by the vibrant and open economy that ensued. We'll examine how each of these individuals found the necessary resources, both economic and personal, to achieve greatness in the business arena. In doing so, we hope not only to arrive at a better understanding of American business history in general, but also to commune with its greatest visionaries. Master's of Enterprise. For more information on this lecture, please visit the course's web page at www.modernscholar.com where you'll have access to links to related sites, a seminar room to share your thoughts with other students, and yes, of course, a final exam. And now we begin Master's of Enterprise, a history of American business and those who who made it, Lecture 1, the business of America, and now Professor Brands. The business of America is business, said Calvin Coolidge, and the history of business is the stories of the people who made it. This course is about American business history. Its format is a series of lectures, of sketches, of important figures in the history of American business. There are going to be several themes that will emerge from this course. One is that the history of American business can be seen as a window on American history generally. There are various ways of examining American history. One can look at the politics, one can look at the ideals, one can look at American military history, one can look at American social or cultural history. Another way of looking at it is through the history of American business. One thing that Americans have done consistently from the 18th century until the present is deal with the problem of how to make a living. And by examining the evolution of American business, of how people have made a living, I think we're going to get a chance to get right at the heart of what American life was like for all sorts of people from then until now. A second theme that's going to emerge from the course is the distinction between business history and economic history. Business history is the history of businesses, of enterprises, of firms. Economic history is the history of the American economy, the larger terms of employment, of production, of the relationships of one industry to another. This is going to play an important role in what we're going to be doing. And in fact, at times I'll be looking at American business history through the lens of American economic history. But it's important to distinguish the two. I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time dealing with matters of employment, with production levels and like. Those will come in to the degree that they affect the businesses and the business people we're dealing with. But for the most part, we're going to be focusing on the history of American business. A third theme that will emerge in the course is the role of entrepreneurs of individual enterprises. Now one shouldn't believe that enterprise, that entrepreneurs are the only important figures in American business. In fact, in the 20th century, the role of corporations of large organizations that are run by groups of people that don't necessarily own the corporations will become important. And we'll follow some of those individuals. But peculiarly in American history, in a history of American business, individual entrepreneurs, the individuals who have the ideas, who start the businesses.",
