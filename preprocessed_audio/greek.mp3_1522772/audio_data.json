Today we begin a course entitled Greek Drama. Your professor is Peter Minick of New York University. Professor Minick is a clinical assistant professor of classics and artist in residence at the New York University Center for Ancient Studies, and the producing artistic director and founder of the Aquila Theater Company. Peter currently teaches in the classics department at New York University in ancient drama, Greek literature, and classical mythology. He has held teaching appointments at Princeton University, the University of South Carolina, and the Tisch School of the Arts. Fellowships include the Harvard Center for Hellenic Studies, the University of California at San Diego and the University of Texas at Austin. He has lectured and held workshops on ancient drama and Shakespeare at conferences, academic institutions, museums, festivals, and schools throughout the world. The plays of one ancient city written 2,500 years ago by just four playwrights have had a profound effect on the development of all subsequent Western drama, not only on the theatrical stage, but opera, film, television, stand-up comedy, and dance. In fact, most, if not all, of the live arts owe a debt to the theater of ancient Greece and the city of Athens. This course will examine the social, historical, and political context of ancient Greek drama and equip listeners with a set of critical and analytical tools for developing their own appreciation of this still vital legacy. We will focus on the four extent playwrights, iskolas, Sophocles, Europides, and Aristophanes, and examine four of each of their plays closely.

And now we begin Greek Drama Lecture 1. Why Athens? And now Professor Maneck. Welcome to this course on Greek Drama. My name is Professor Peter Maneck and I'm going to be your guide through what I consider some of the most important plays written in historical canon. This course is going to ask the question, why is Greek drama important to us today? What are the origins of Greek drama? What are the social, historical and dramatic background of these plays? Who are the Greek dramatists? What were their lives, their history, their times? And how have these plays impacted later drama and the drama of today? This course is going to look specifically at the work of Fifth Century Drama, which has where come to learn is the main period, sometimes called the golden age of Greek drama, although I don't really like that term, but this is certainly the main period of Greek drama in the 5th century BCE in Athens. And it's going to concentrate on four playwrights, Ascolus, Sophocles, Euripides and Aristophanes. What I've decided to do with this course is really take you on the in-depth analysis of the work of these playwrights, more than just as literature, but really what do these plays mean to the Athenians? Why were they produced? Who was watching them? What was their political background? Their social background and their religious origins? We're going to talk about most of the works of these four playwrights, but we're going to specifically look at four plays by each of our four playwrights. And these will be the plays that we'll be reading through this course. And we're going to pick on one play by each playwright to look at very closely indeed. So for ascolus we're going to read the Persians and the Orostyre. The Orostyre is our only surviving trilogy and is made up of the Agamemnon, libation bearers and furies. With Sofakles we're going to study Ajax, Philip T.T.'s, Ederpastyrinus and Ederpastuklonus. And we'll talk about other works of Sofakles of course in the course of this lecture. For Euripides, the Medea, Hecuba, Trojan women and the the back eye and when we turn to Greek comedy and the works of Aristophanes, we can have a great deal of fun with the hilarious plays, clouds, wasps, birds and frogs. So the first question I have for you is, why study Greek drama? Why is it important to understand this stuff and have a detailed knowledge of it? Well I think it's interesting to start with a question that I always ask my students, what is the meaning of the word theatre? a word that we apply now to, going to the cinemasing movies, also to the physical building that we watch performance in and to the genre of drama itself. But what does theatre mean? Well, theatre is of course a Greek term, and we owe a great debt to the Athenians and the Greeks in general in terms of providing us with this form of theatre or drama. Well theatre is from a Greek word theatre, and it actually means seeing place, a place of sight, a place where we go to see drama, to see place. And this is important. Because as we will be studying these texts, I will constantly be trying to remind you that these plays work as well as texts were visual works of art. There was design, masks, costume, dance, music, blocking. There was an element to these productions that appealed to the visual sense of the ancient Athenians and these plays were put on in a form that gave them the magnitude and the presence that is demanded of Greek tragedy and comedy. So theatre means seeing place and we're constantly coming back to this idea of the visual element in ancient drama. But look at our depth to the Athenians and Athenian drama and let's just look at some of the terms that have come down to us that have become embedded in the",
